When you connect to the server firstly you must create your character , then you load it and after X time you're spawned, it's controllable by cvar.
You can also delete your character, each character have their heroes, each hero have their special abbilities and skills.
Killing enemy you get more experience, gold and with needed experience value you get new level , new stats points, new skills points, by the new level you can raise your stats , which gives you more power, skills with which you can cast your magic skills.
